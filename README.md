# React Zentry UI Clone

A learning project where I recreated the zentry.com landing page using React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and GSAP. 

This isnâ€™t a pixel-perfect copy but a hands-on exercise to understand animations, responsive design, and modern build tools.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/itsYuuuka/react-zentry-ui.git
cd react-zentry-ui
npm install

# Run locally
npm run dev
